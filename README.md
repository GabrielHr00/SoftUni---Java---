# Unity--3D--FirstGame
The Game should be a prototype of a simple jumping game in all the ways. So we can collect coins and kill red monsters if we step on them. The levels are only two and the finish line is also obvious. Thats my very first Unity 3D game and was learned from a tutorial in YouTube, so the Code may be similar to the one in the video! The monsters, which can kill you are sliding platforms, which are similar to the floor platforms, which slide to 2 endpoints, so the game can be more interacting.
